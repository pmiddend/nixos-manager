** Configure services

** Rationale

The idea is to build something to *configure NixOS graphically*. To me, this means: managing the installed software packages, and managing the enabled services, as well as updating and garbage-collecting. For the moment, I’m focusing on a solution for a declarative, global configuration; so /for the moment/ it’s not calling =nix-env= and it’s not supporting =home-manager=.

The goal is *not* to make all of NixOS accessible via a GUI, and not give an alternative to writing Nix expressions for your configuration. Instead, this is a project to explore how far you can get graphically after installing NixOS (which — in the future — might be possible via a GUI installer as well).

** Approach

Since the NixOS configuration is very “free-form”, I have to make some assumptions about the structure of your =configuration.nix= file, as such:

- You have two additional =.nix= files, referenced from the =imports= section in your =configuration.nix=: =packages.nix= and =services.nix=
- =packages.nix= is a flat list of packages
- =services.nix= is a list of service options, like ~services.xserver.enable = true~.

In nixos-manager, you can mark packages for installation. They will be added to your /local/ copy of =packages.nix=. You can then trigger a nixos-rebuild from inside nixos-manager, which copies your local installation to the /global installation/ inside =/etc/nixos/nixos-manager/packages.nix=. Same for configuring services and =services.nix=.

To gather service definitions, nixos-manager downloads and parses https://nixos.org/nixos/options.json. This way, the service definitions might not accurately reflect your system configuration, but I just found no other way to gather the definitions, see [[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/list-available-services-and-their-options/][this Discourse thread]].

** FAQ

*** Have you seen [[https://github.com/haskell-nix/hnix][hnix]]? Why don’t you parse your you Nix files with

I’d love to! But sadly and ironically, it’s currently [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/82233][broken]] in nixpkgs. I’m waiting for someone to repair it, as I don’t have the knowledge to do that.

I’m using Haskell as the language of choice, simply because =hnix= is available and allows me to easily parse and serialize the relevant Nix configuration files. The GUI is made via =gi-gtk-declarative=, which serves me well and is pretty stable.

*** Can I configure NixOS using this tool and manually at the same time?

Yes, that’s possible. The files that nixos-manager uses shouldn’t be edited by hand, but you can configure services and packages the regular way as well, by editing =configuration.nix=. Thus, nixos-manager is just an enhancement.

*** The list of packages only lists packages installed by nixos-manager, not globally installed ones. How come?

The simple reason is: I haven’t gotten to that part yet, and my Nix knowledge is so limited I’d have to ask how do that first.

** Building

nixos-manager isn’t in nixpkgs yet, so you’ll have to build it using…Nix!

#+begin_src bash
nix-build
#+end_src

This would suffice, /if/ =gi-gtk-declarative= wasn’t broken in nixpkgs currently (its tests don’t work). So you have to allow the installation of “broken packages”. The error message you get will tell you how, but the simplest way is:

#+begin_src bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/nixpkgs && echo "{ allowBroken = true; }" > $HOME/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix
#+end_src

*Caution*: this will overwrite any existing =config.nix= file. Check that first.

After the build processed has finished, run =result/bin/nixos-manager=.

** Setup

To use nixos-manager, you have to tell NixOS to read its configuration files. To do that, open your =/etc/nixos/configuration.nix= file and look for a line containing ~imports = …~. Usually it looks something like this:

#+begin_src nix
{
  # …
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ];
  # …
}
#+end_src

So =imports= contains an array of Nix files. You can extend this array by just listing more files, separated by spaces. To use NixOS manager, extend the list as such:

#+begin_src nix
{
  # …
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      ./nixos-manager/services.nix
      ./nixos-manager/packages.nix
    ];
  # …
}
#+end_src

nixos-manager will create these two files when you apply changes.

** Current status

- The frontend for =nixos-rebuild= works. It supports =--upgrade= and =--rollback=.
- =nix-collect-garbage= is also supported, supporting the =-d= flag.
- Rebuilding copies =packages.nix= and =services.nix= to =/etc/nixos/nixos-manager=. Without these files being included in your =configuration.nix=, they’re worthless, though.
- Configuring services works, with some minor quirks.
- Trying packages works, and installing/uninstalling too. The =packages.nix= will be updated accordingly.

*** Prerequisites

- nixos-manager is written in [[https://www.haskell.org/][the Haskell Language]]. You should be proficient with this language. I can’t give a full recommendation list for learning it (can anyone reading this?). It’s /really/ worth it though. Some books are

- I’m using [[https://www.gtk.org/][the GTK toolkit]] and specifically [[https://owickstrom.github.io/gi-gtk-declarative/][gi-gtk-declarative]] as a declarative approach to writing GTK applications. The documentation is [[https://owickstrom.github.io/gi-gtk-declarative/widgets/the-widget-type/][here]].

*** Code structure

Each module has haddock documentation. Finding information about the code just from that might be difficult though, so let me give you a short overview: *TODO*.
